== Welcome to MeNUS
This Developer Guide is written by the MeNUS v1.4 team for the benefits of future developers and maintainers of the
application.

* This guide includes instructions for setting up the development environment.

* This guide provides sufficient UMLs (unified model diagrams) to illustrate the architectural structure and design
methodology.

* This guide offers advice for troubleshooting some common issues.

MeNUS is an open-source project, should any developers be interested, see the link:{repoURL}/docs/AboutUs.adoc[`Contact
Us`] page
 for more information.

=== Legends
The following *3* legends will be used throughout the documentation which you may wish to pay attention to as it may
contain important details:

[NOTE]
Just for your info, do not be alarmed!

[TIP]
Perhaps something can be done using another approach, but it is up to you to decide.

[WARNING]
Some things might go wrong if you are not careful, or did not follow the instructions correctly; strongly advised to
read whatever is in this block.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`*
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFX plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding
standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify:

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("register
id/azhikai pw/1122qq")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::RegisterAccountSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagramNew.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Restaurant Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedRestaurantBook`.
It extends `RestaurantBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `restaurantBookStateList` and
`currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedRestaurantBook#commit()` -- Saves the current restaurant book state in its history.
* `VersionedRestaurantBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous restaurant book state from its history.
* `VersionedRestaurantBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone restaurant book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#RestaurantBook()`, `Model#undoRestaurantBook()` and
`Model#redoRestaurantBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedRestaurantBook` will be initialized with the initial restaurant book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single restaurant book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the restaurant book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the restaurant book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `restaurantBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted restaurant book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitRestaurantBook()`, causing another modified restaurant book state to be saved into the `restaurantBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitRestaurantBook()`, so the restaurant book state will not be saved into the `restaurantBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous restaurant book state, and restores the restaurant book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial restaurant book state, then there are no previous restaurant book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the restaurant book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `restaurantBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest restaurant book state, then there are no undone restaurant book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the restaurant book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `restaurantBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `restaurantBookStateList`, all restaurant book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire restaurant book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of restaurant book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== User account feature
==== Current Implementation

The user account mechanism is facilitated by `RestaurantBook`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `RestaurantBook#getAccount(Account)` -- Retrieves the account.
* `RestaurantBook#addAccount(Account)` -- Saves the new account.
* `RestaurantBook#updateAccount(Account, Account)` -- Update the existing account.
* `RestaurantBook#removeAccount(Account)` -- Removes the account.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#getAccount(Account)`, `Model#addAccount(Account)`,
`Model#updateAccount(Account, Account)` and `Model#removeAccount(Account)`. The following commands will
invoke the aforementioned operations:

* `Command#LoginCommand()` -- Invokes `Model#getAccount(Account)`.
* `Command#RegisterCommand()` -- Invokes `Model#addAccount(Account)`.
* `Command#DeregisterCommand()` -- Invokes `Model#removeAccount(Account)`.
* `Command#EditCommand()` -- Invokes `Model#updateAccount(Account, Account)`.

Described below are example usage scenarios and how each of the command and its respective operations behaves at each
step which involves two components, `Logic` which is responsible for parsing the user input and `Model` which is
responsible for manipulating the list, if necessary. Both components are extended by `LogicManager` and
`ModelManager` respectively.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `register` command works:

[NOTE]
The `deregister` command works the same way by checking if the account exists before calling `Model#removeAccount
(Account)`.

.Sequence diagram to illustrate component interactions for the `register` command
image::RegisterSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
We assume the user is already logged in
[NOTE]
If the username already exists, a warning message will be shown to the user to select another username

Step 1. The user executes `register id/azhikai pw/1122qq` command to create a new user account.

Step 2. `LogicManager` invokes the `RestaurantBookParser#parseCommand()` method which takes in the user input
as arguments.

Step 3. When the command is parsed, the `Command#RegisterCommand` will be created which is returned to the
`LogicManager`.

Step 4. `LogicManager` invokes the `execute()` method of the `Command#RegisterCommand`, `rc` which is instantiated in
Step 3. The `Model` component will be involved as the `Command#RegisterCommand` invokes a request to add the account
into the storage by calling `Model#addAccount(Account)`.

Step 5: The new account is added into the storage. Then, a `CommandResult` is generated and returned to
`LogicManager` which is used to display the result to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `login` command works:

.Sequence diagram to illustrate component interactions for the `login` command
image::LoginSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
We assume the user will enter the correct password. Otherwise, warning message will be shown to the user to re-enter
the credential

Step 1. The user executes `login id/azhikai pw/1122qq` command to login to an existing user account.

Step 2. `LogicManager` invokes the `RestaurantBookParser#parseCommand()` method which takes in the user input
as arguments.

Step 3. When the command is parsed, the `Command#LoginCommand` will be created which is returned to the
`LogicManager`.

Step 4. `LogicManager` invokes the `execute()` method of the `Command#LoginCommand`, `lc` which is instantiated in Step 3.
The `Model` component will be involved as the `Command#LoginCommand` invokes a request to retrieve an account based
on the username. If it exists, the account will be retrieved and the password hash will be compared. If it matches,
then the credential is valid and the user is authenticated.

=== User session feature
==== Current Implementation

[NOTE]
If a privileged command is executed when a session is not set, an error will be shown. The only commands that can
be executed without a session being set are `help`, `login` and `exit`. Any other commands are considered privileged

The user session is facilitated by `UserSession` which stores the authentication state of the application.
This is triggered by raising a `Login` and `Logout` event upon executing either the `Command#LoginCommand()` or
`Command#LogoutCommand()`. +

Additionally, it implements the following static operations:

* `UserSession#login()` -- Set a login session.
* `UserSession#logout()` -- Removes the existing login session.
* `UserSession#isAuthenticated()` -- Checks if there is an existing login session.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the user session mechanism behaves at each step.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user logs in or out:

image::UserSessionActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

The following code snippet demonstrates how these static methods are implemented:

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Stores this {@link Account} info as part of this session.
 *
 * @param account logged in for this session.
 */
public static void login(Account account) {
    isAuthenticated = true;
    username = account.getUsername();
}

/**
 * Logs out of this account which releases this session.
 */
public static void logout() {
    if (isAuthenticated) {
        isAuthenticated = false;
        username = null;
    }
}
----

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How user session is handled

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use static flags and methods.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Can only support one user at any time. If another user wants to login, the current logged in user must log out.
* **Alternative 2:** Store a list of user sessions to allow multiple login.
** Pros: More user can login and manage the systems concurrently.
** Cons: More memory usage to track each user session.

// tag::displaySales[]
=== Display sales report feature
==== Current Implementation

The display sales report mechanism is facilitated by the Model, UI and Event components of the App. A `SalesReport`
class encapsulates the attributes of a sales report to be displayed.
The sales report is internally generated by `generateSalesReport(Date)` in `UniqueRecordList`. It then
propagates up the Model call hierarchy to `getSalesReport(Date)` in `ModelManager`, which is exposed in the `Model`
interface.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the display sales report operation works when the user enters `display-sales 25-12-2017`

image::DisplaySalesSequenceDiagram.png[width="1300"]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the display sales report operation behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `display-sales 25-12-2017` command to request for the sales report dated 25-12-2017. The
`display-sales` command calls `Model#getSalesReport(Date)`, passing in the date "25-12-2017", and gets the generated
`SalesReport` in return.

[NOTE]
`display-sales` command will not call `Model#getSalesReport(Date)` if the specified date is invalid.

Step 2. The `display-sales` command then raises the `DisplaySalesReportEvent` event, which also encapsulates the
generated `SalesReport` in step 1.

Step 3. The `EventsCenter` reacts to the above event, which results in `handleDisplaySalesReportEvent(Event)`
in UI's `MainWindow` being called. This method instantiates a `SalesReportWindow` object by passing in the
`SalesReport` to its constructor. This `SalesReportWindow` acts as the controller for the sales report window.

Step 4. The `SalesReportWindow` is then initialized and displayed on user's screen.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How `SalesReport` is generated internally
 * **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `generateSalesReport(Date)` in `UniqueRecordList` filters the entire record
 list. Records that match the given `Date` are added into an `ObservableList<SalesRecord>`. The `SalesReport` is
 generated based on the list.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Execution is of linear time complexity and would be considerably slow should the list size be very large.
* **Alternative 2:** Maintain another list that sorts itself by date every time it is modified. Conduct a binary
search to fill in the `ObservableList<SalesRecord>` every time a sales report is requested.
** Pros: `SalesReport` can be generated with a O(logN) time complexity.
** Cons: Sorting after every input would require O(NlogN) time which is slow. Additionally, the sorted list also
takes up an O(N) memory space.
// end::displaySales[]

// tag::deleteingredient[]
===  Delete Ingredient feature
==== Current Implementation

The delete ingredient mechanism is facilitated by `DeleteIngredientCommand`. It is implemented as an abstract class
with the following abstract methods:

* `DeleteIngredientCommand#execute()` – Removes a specified ingredient from the list
* `DeleteIngredientCommand#equals()` – Checks if two `DeleteIngredientCommand` instances have the same attributes

`DeleteIngredientByIndexCommand` and `DeleteIngredientByNameCommand` extends `DeleteIngredientCommand` and implement
their own behaviour for these methods.

The following sequence diagrams illustrate how the delete operation works.

* Diagram 1: When user enters `delete-ingredient 1`

image::DeleteIngredientByIndexSequenceDiagram.png[width="1000"]

* Diagram 2: When user enters `delete-ingredient apple`

image::DeleteIngredientByNameSequenceDiagram.png[width="1000"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of delete ingredient command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate classes to handle deleting by index and deleting by name.
** Pros: Allows different attributes and method implementation for each class.
** Cons: Tight coupling between `DeleteIngredientCommand` and the inheriting classes
* **Alternative 2:** Single class to handle deleting by both index and name.
** Pros: Less coupling since the methods related to the delete ingredient command are confined to a single class.
** Cons: Two attributes are required, but only one has a value while the other has to be set to null. This makes the
`equals()` method difficult to implement.
// end::deleteingredient[]

// tag::menu[]
=== Menu Management feature
Menu management feature extends `MeNuS` with a menu and provides the users with the ability to add items to the
menu, edit items and remove items from the menu.

==== Current Implementation
The menu is stored internally as `items`, which is a `UniqueItemList` object that contains a list of `Item` objects.
The menu management feature implements the following operations:

* `add-item` command -- Adds an item to the menu. The item must not already exist in the menu.
* `edit-item` command -- Replaces the target item with the editedItem. Target item
 must be in the menu and editedItem must not be the same as another existing item in the menu.
* `delete-item` command -- Removes the equivalent item from the menu. The item must exist in the menu.
* `list-items` command -- Lists all the items in the menu.
* `select-item` command -- Selects an item in the menu and loads the page of the selected item.
* `sort-menu` -- Sorts the menu by name or price. The user must specify the sorting method.
* `find-item` command -- Finds items whose names contain any of the given keywords.
* `filter-menu` command -- Finds items whose tags contain any of the given keywords.
* `today-special` command -- Finds items whose tags contain the `DAY_OF_THE_WEEK`.

Each `Item` object consists of `Name` and `Price`.
[NOTE]
`Name` is a separate class from the `Name` used by `Person`, but is functionally the same.

==== `add-item` Command
The `add-item` command is facilitated by `AddItemCommand` and `AddItemCommandParser`. The command takes in
user input for `Name`, `Price` and `Tag`(optional).

The `AddItemCommandParser` will parse the user input and checks if the input is valid.
It will then construct an `Item` object.
[NOTE]
If the input is not valid, it will throw a `ParseException`.

The `AddItemCommand` will indirectly call the `UniqueItemList#add(Item toAdd)` and the adds the item.
After adding the item, it will save the current state for undo/redo.

==== `sort-menu` Command
The `sort-menu` command is facilitated by `SortMenuCommand` and `SortMenuCommandParser`. The command takes in
user input for the sorting method.
[NOTE]
Currently only sort by name or price.

The `SortMenuCommandParser` will parse the user input and checks if the input is valid.
[NOTE]
If the input is not valid, it will throw a `ParseException`.

The `SortMenuCommand` will indirectly call the `UniqueItemList#sortItemsByName()` or
`UniqueItemList#sortItemsByPrice()` and the sorts the menu.
After sorting the menu, it will save the current state for undo/redo.

==== `filter-menu` Command
The `filter-menu` command is facilitated by `FilterMenuCommand` and `FilterMenuCommandParser`. The command takes in
user input for the keywords.

The `FilterMenuCommandParser` will parse the user input and checks if the input is valid and constructs an
`TagContainsKeywordsPredicate` object.
[NOTE]
If the input is not valid, it will throw a `ParseException`.

The `FilterMenuCommand` will directly call the `ModelManager#updateFilteredItemList(Predicate<Item> predicate)` and
set the predicate for `ModelManger#filteredItems`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How `Price` is parsed

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `Price` is parsed without the currency symbol.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Only able to display `Price` with `$` with 2 decimal place.

=== Reservations feature
The Reservations feature allows users to store customer reservations, view them, and to cancel them.

==== Current Implementation
The Reservations feature currently contains 3 commands to modify the `UniqueReservationsList` stored in `ModelManager`.

* `add-reservation` command - Adds reservations to the reservations list.
* `edit-reservation` command - Edits existing reservations in the reservations list.
* `delete-reservation` command - Deletes existing reservations in the reservations list.

Each `Reservation` object contains `Name`, `Pax`, and `LocalDateTime`.

[NOTE]
`Name` is a separate class from the `Name` used by `Person`, but is functionally the same.

==== `add-reservation` Command
The `add-reservation` command follows similar implementation of the current `add` command.

The command takes in 3 parameters, `Name`, `Pax`, and `DateTime` to create a `Reservation` object.

After the `Reservation` Object is created, AddressBook#addReservation(Reservation reservation) is called to add the
`Reservation` Object to the `UniqueReservationsList`.

==== `edit-reservation` Command
The `edit-reservation` command follows similar implementation of the current `edit` command.

The command takes in 1 mandatory parameter, `Index`, followed by **1 or more** of the following  optional parameters,
 `Name`, `Pax`, `DateTime`.

The `Reservation` associated with the given `Index` is then identified within the internal `UniqueReservationsList`,
then has its values updated to the new values specified by the `Name`, `Pax`, and `DateTime` parameters.

==== `delete-reservation` Command
The `delete-reservation` command follows similar implementation of the current `delete` command.

The command takes in 1 parameter, `Index`.

The `Reservation` associated with the given `Index` is then identified, then deleted from the internal
`UniqueReservationsList`.

==== Design Considerations
*Aspect: How DateTime is stored*

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `Reservation` stores the Date and Time by wrapping it in a `LocalDateTime` object.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Unable to easily change attributes like how the Date and Time are displayed, and unable to store Message
Constraints as it is not its own dedicated class.

* **Alternative 2:** Create dedicated `DateTime` class.
** Pros: This will solve the aforementioned issues of not having a dedicated class to store the Date and Time.

*Aspect: How DateTime is parsed*

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `DateTime` is parsed in the format ``yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss``
** Pros: Easy to implement as the `LocalDateTime` object can directly parse this format without any additional input
manipulation.
** Cons: Unintuitive and troublesome to enter the fields. Additionally, it is unnecessary to keep track of the
`Seconds` field in the context of restaurant reservations.

* **Alternative 2:** Use `Natty` library for `DateTime` parsing
** Pros: Natty uses natural language parsing, so the user can enter the `Date` and `Time` fields in their preferred
format.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

**Problem: Test failed with `Missing newline at end of file`.**

* Reason: A newline is missing in the file.
* Solution: `File` > `Settings...` > `Editor` > `General` > `Ensure line feed at file end on Save`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size). +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers).
