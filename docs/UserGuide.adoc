== Introduction
As the name implies, link:{repoURL}[MeNUS] helps you improve the Management(M) and its efficiency(e) of your
restaurants in NUS.

MeNUS is for restaurant owners who prefer to use a desktop application to manage their restaurants. More importantly,
MeNUS is *optimized for users who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits
of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)*. If you can type fast, MeNUS allows you to manage all aspects of your eatery
from a single location -- menu, inventory, sales and bookings management!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `menus.jar` link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-4/main/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
